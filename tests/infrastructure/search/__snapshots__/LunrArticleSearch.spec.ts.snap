Injury guidelines

If any question about management, consult!


In evaluating all injuries, consider underlying/overlying tissue/organ injury, as well as proximal/distal musculoskeletal/joint and neurovascular injury or compromise.
In children comparison views may be needed to demonstrate a fracture (fx). If initial x-rays do not demonstrate a fracture, but suspicion is high, treat as fracture and repeat exam and x-ray in 1-2 weeks. Consider Salter I epiphysis fracture or apophysitis, if tender over growth plate but negative x-ray.
X-ray all dislocations (except for radial head subluxation in children) before and after reduction.
Most fractures encountered are stable and require protection more than immobilization, making removable splints treatment options, especially while swelling subsides. Consequently, in these guidelines splinting and casting are frequently interchangeable, including pneumatic splints.
Spiral or oblique shaft, &gt;2 part/comminuted, intra-articular, &amp; post reduction fractures are potentially unstable!
Unstable fractures require casting/splinting not only for protection but also stability (+/- cast molding), with splints/casts including the joint on both sides of the fracture; then re-evaluation (assessing cast/splint fit) and x-ray every 3-7 days until swelling gone and stability assured.
All rotational deformities must be corrected at the time of fracture reduction, and treated as unstable.
In these guidelines, recommendations for consultation assume findings after any attempted dislocation/fracture reduction, using appropriate analgesia. Attempt reductions only within your experience, or per consultants direction! Document neurovascular status after reductions.
All injuries treated acutely with RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) x 2-7 days (until swelling decreased), analgesia, and immobilization. For soft-tissue injuries, after the acute injury phase, range of motion (ROM) with cold vs heat locally to speed healing.  Consult as needed for muscle, tendon, or ligament ruptures, and follow-up prn concerns about underlying injury or protracted recovery.
If slow recovery, consider frequent follow-up visits, +/- orthopedic or physical therapy (PT) consult.


If history and physical findings do not concur, consider underlying pathology/disease and/or physical abuse!

Suspect physical abuse with the following fractures, especially in infants: fractures of ribs, long bone metaphysis, scapula, spinous process, and sternum; or if multiple fractures, fractures of different ages and/or stages of healing, or complex skull fractures.

Clavicle fracture - sling +/- figure of eight splint for 2-8 weeks (less in children with torus or undisplaced fx); R/O underlying and neurovascular injury; consult if markedly displaced, proximal or distal fx with &lt;50% bony apposition or &gt;40 degrees angulation (+/- weights), displaced proximal or distal intraarticular fx, or if concern about mal/non-union (comminuted or &gt;2 cm initial overlap of mid-shaft fx).
Scapula fracture - body or spine fx, sling for 1-4 weeks, with early ROM; R/O underlying injury; consult if neck angulation &gt;30 degrees,or if displaced, esp. if glenoid, acromion, or coracoid process involvement.

Sternum fracture - consult if displaced, and as usually with high-energy trauma, rule out underlying injury and polytrauma, and transfer if underlying injury, polytrauma, or isolated sternal fracture but anticipated poor outpatient pain control.
Rib fracture - analgesia; only transient or intermittent prn use of rib belt, to avoid atlectasis/pneumonia; R/O underlying injury (esp. if multiple rib fxs); consult for displaced fx or flail chest injury.

Steroid injections


for injury-related inflammation
steroids should always be reserved for injuries that have not responded to the usual healing times and conservative measures, and there is no infection component.  Avoid use in children/teens!
conditions that may respond to steroid use: rotator cuff tendinitis, impingement syndrome, subacromial bursitis, adhesive capsulitis, bicipital tendinitis, triceps tendinitis, humeral (medial and lateral) epicondylitis, olecranon bursitis, extensor carpi radialis tendinitis, de Quervain's tendinitis (extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus tendons), carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger (flexor tenosynovitis), trochanteric bursitis, patellar tendinitis, prepatellar bursitis, popliteus tendinitis and iliotibial band inflammation (over lateral femoral condyle), anserine bursitis (over posteromedial tibial condyle), Achilles tendinitis, tarsal tunnel syndrome, plantar fasciitis, and any non-infectious arthritis. Avoid injecting into tendons!
Use: 0.5-1.5 inch, 22-25 gauge  needle (18-20 gauge if aspirating); &lt;0.5-10 ml of local anesthetic; &amp; &lt;0.5-2 ml of steroid (betamethasone and dexamethasone 1-10 mg, triamcinolone and methylprednisolone 2-80 mg) - larger needles &amp; doses for larger joints. Maximum of 3 injections per location per year.

Pelvis fractures

(see THORAX AND SPINE FRACTURES also)
Pelvis fracture - pain with posterior pressure on iliac crests, compressing iliac wings, and posterior pressure on pubic symphysis (consider symphyseal separation).


stable (non-displaced with pelvic ring intact, and no internal hemorrhage) - consider initial IV and hospitalization, CT, analgesia, bed-rest, non-weight bearing on affected side, (low energy fx from falls in elderly frequently Rx with analgesia and protected weight bearing with walker for 6+ wks) &amp; consult, esp. if unstable, involving acetabular or sacroiliac joints, or non-union, or pain &gt;12 wks.
unstable (displaced, pelvic ring disrupted or fx in 2 or more sites or internal hemorrhage/shock), usually with hx of high energy mechanism of injury - IV, MAST prn, hospitalize and consult.
R/O associated GU, GI, neurovascular, and lower-extremity injury; Rx shock and avoid foley if high-riding prostate, blood at urethral meatus, scrotal hematoma, or fx of ischial or pubic rami.


Anterior superior (or inferior) iliac spine avulsion fracture vs apophysitis - origin of  Sartorius muscle ( or rectus femoris) - rest with hip flexion (+/- abduction for inferior avulsion fx) +/- crutches +/- immobilization x 2-4 wks, then rehab x 4-6 wks; consult if displaced (&gt;1 cm) or professional athlete.
Iliac crest avulsion fracture vs apophysitis (origin of external oblique and transversus abdominus muscles) - rest x 2-4 wks, then rehab x 4-6 wks; consult if displaced &gt;1 cm, or professional athlete.
Ischial tuberosity avulsion fracture vs apophysitis (origin of adductor magnus, semitendinosus and semimembranosus muscles) - rest with hip extension and external rotation +/- crutches x 2-4 wks, then rehab x 4-6 wks; consult if displaced &gt;1 cm, or professional athlete.
