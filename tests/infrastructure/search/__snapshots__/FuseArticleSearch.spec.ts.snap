Cervical spine injuries

(beyond the common sprain/strain)


if at risk for unstable fx, obtain and read cross-table lateral x-ray, before full c-spine series.
R/O cord injury by hx and exam, and R/O neurogenic shock - Rx with vasopressors.
all cervical spine fractures/dislocations/subluxations need CT and consult.
all c-spine injuries require immobilization without traction prior to consult; stable injuries (beyond minor strains) Rx'ed with hard collar x 2 months, &amp; unstable injuries with skull traction +/- ORIF.


Occipital condyle fracture or instability - &gt;2 mm from occiput to atlas, or &gt;12 mm from basion to odontoid.
C1 isolated anterior or posterior arch fx - stable if non-displaced.
C1 lateral mass fx - unstable; possible lateral mass displacement as in Jefferson fx below. 
C1 Jefferson fx - unstable; blow-out/burst fx of ring with transverse ligament rupture, usually seen in lamina on lateral view and as lateral displacement (&gt;3 mm of either side) of C1 lateral masses on AP odontoid view; 1/3 also with C2 fx.
C1 rotary subluxation - unstable; disparity in C1 lateral mass distance from odontoid +/- lateral mass overlap on C2; seen mostly in children with torticollis presentation post-injury - avoid attempts to derotate the injured neck!
C2 odontoid dislocation - unstable; rupture of C1 transverse ligament with consequent posterior dislocation of dens, with predens space &gt;3mm (&gt;5mm peds); may occur without neuro findings as at this level spinal canal with cord in 1/3, dens in 1/3, and ligament/space in 1/3.
C2 odontoid fx - unstable or stable.
C2 Hangman's fx - unstable; C2 pedicle/posterior element fx +/- C2 body displaced anterior on C3.
C2-C7 Injuries


consider prevertebral hematoma (on lateral c-spine x-ray) if: 1. At C2-C3 anterior-inferior border, prevertebral soft-tissue thickness &gt;6mm in adults or &gt;2/3 thickness of C2 body in children (who are not crying or forcing expiration!). 2. Prevertebral soft tissue thickness below larynx is &gt;vertebral body thickness, or &gt;20-22 mm at C6.
consider fx or dislocation if vertebral malalignment &gt;3 mm (&gt;4-5 mm peds).
consider fx or dislocation if intervertebral angle &gt; 11 degrees.
consider compression fx if anterior body height &gt;3 mm shorter than posterior.
consider spinal cord compression if &gt;6 yrs old and AP spinal canal space &lt;10-13 mm.


Teardrop fracture (flexion or extension) - unstable, with inclusion of posterior element injury; chip fx off anterior-inferior (flexion injury-very unstable) or anterior-superior aspect of vertebral body +/- body comminution.
Bilateral facet dislocation - unstable; usually with &gt;50% body displacement.
Unilateral facet dislocation/subluxation - unstable or stable; usually &lt;25% body displacement noted with overlapping facets on lateral view, anterior decreased disc space, posterior decreased disc space, and increased interspinous distance.
Simple wedge and bursting vertebral body fracture - usually stable, unless fragments of burst enter canal.
Posterior element fracture - usually stable if isolated.
Spinous process fracture - stable; most commonly involving C6, C7, or T1 (Clay-Shoveler's fx)
